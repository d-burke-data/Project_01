# Project_01 : U.S. Housing Constraints

This project analyzes several factors to determine their relation to housing in the United States. These factors include: household income, population growth, interest rates, building permits, unemployment, and education. We have found some of these factors are correlated while others are not. We also identified several trends in housing, such as declining home affordability and fluctuations due to the 2008 housing crisis as well as COVID in 2020.
